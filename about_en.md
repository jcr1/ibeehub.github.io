# About Us

iBeehub was created by a group of serial entrepreneurs with the goal of incubating new startups. iBeehub not only provides seed capital, but it also helps passionate and experienced founders with recruiting, product strategy, and product development.  

iBeehub was launched by a group of alumni from the reputable university-Peking University. Their common passion for entrepreneurship brought them to New York, where they launched iBeehub at Deloitte on April 17th, 2015. At Deloitte, located at the Rockefeller Center, the group of alumni presented to some top senior investors about the unique idea and the innovative business model in their hands. The investors were not only impressed about the idea, but also ready to offer financial support to bring iBeehub to launch the business.

#JR: Name: I would drop the "i" in iBeehub.  In the US, this sort of thing feels stale 
# I don't like the content in the last paragraph.  It would be better to talk about what experience the team has, how much money # to invest, how many investments they want to do a year, what sort of companies or founders they look for, etc.
